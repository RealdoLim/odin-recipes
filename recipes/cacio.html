    <h2>Simple Cacio e Pepe</h2>
    <p>Along with carbonara and amatriciana, cacio e pepe is one of Rome's essential pasta dishes, served at restaurants all over the Italian capital. Like many of the Eternal City's best dishes, a good cacio e pepe recipe is about simplicity. Classic versions call for just pasta, salted water, freshly ground pepper, and Pecorino Romano, a Roman sheep's milk cheese. Ours tosses a bit of Grana Padano or Parmesan into the mix for a more rounded cheese flavor that melds warmth, nuttiness, and sharpness. When combined properly, all the elements come together like sorcery into a lusciously cheesy dish with a creamy sauce. </p>
    <p>Cacio e pepe is best served immediately, so be sure to set your table before you start cooking.</p>
